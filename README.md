## Path finding alphabet 

### A different approach of visualising

#### A variation of Shiffman's visualisation of A star algorithm. Tried to write a whole sentence "To be or not to be" using A* algorithm. Basically algorithm was finding each letter from the grid. 

[Shiffman's visualisation can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k)

Demo of the visualisation:
